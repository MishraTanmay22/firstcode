    <h2>Chapter one </h2>
    <p>
        <strong>
            In this chapter, 
            Two armies, those of the Pandavas and the Kauravas, face each other on the Battlefield of Kurukshetra. 
            Many signs indicate victory for the Pandavas. Dhrtarashtra, the Pandavas’ uncle and the Kauravas’ father, 
            doubts the possibility of his sons’ victory and asks Sanjaya, his secretary, to describe the scene on the battlefield.

Arjuna, one of five Pandava brothers, undergoes a crisis just before the fight. He is overwhelmed by compassion for his family members and teachers, whom he is supposed to kill. After submitting before Krishna many noble and moral reasons why he wishes not to fight, Arjuna casts aside his weapons, overwhelmed with grief. Arjuna’s reluctance to fight indicates his kind heart; He is in moh.
